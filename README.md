Financial News Sentiment and Stock Market Movements
Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between financial news sentiment and stock market movements. It involves analyzing financial news headlines and their correlation with stock price data for seven major companies: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA). The goal is to understand how news sentiment influences stock prices and to develop predictive models that can inform investment strategies.

Core Objectives and Project Goals
Objective 1: Analyze financial news sentiment and its impact on stock market movements.

Objective 2: Identify correlations between news sentiment and stock price changes.

Objective 3: Develop insights into how news sentiment can be used to predict stock price trends.

Goal 1: Provide a detailed understanding of sentiment trends and their effect on stock prices.

Goal 2: Offer actionable insights for investors and financial analysts based on sentiment analysis.

Implementation Process

1. Data Collection
